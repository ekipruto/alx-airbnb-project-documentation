Project Requirements for the Airbnb Clone Backend
Objective:
Learners will identify and document the key features and functionalities of the Airbnb Clone backend by understanding the technical and functional requirements necessary for building a scalable, secure, and robust system.
Introduction to Project Requirements
Backend development involves creating the server-side logic, database management, and API integrations that power a web application. In this concept page, we will focus on the backend requirements for the Airbnb Clone project, emphasizing the key features that make the app functional, user-friendly, and efficient.
The requirements outlined below are categorized into Core Functionalities, Technical Requirements, and Non-Functional Requirements.
Core Functionalities
The backend for the Airbnb Clone must enable key features that align with the functionalities of a rental marketplace.
1. User Management
‚Ä¢	User Registration:

o	Allow users to sign up as guests or hosts.
o	Use secure authentication methods like JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
‚Ä¢	User Login and Authentication:

o	Implement login via email and password.
o	Include OAuth options (e.g., Google, Facebook).
‚Ä¢	Profile Management:

o	Enable users to update their profiles, including profile photos, contact info, and preferences.
2. Property Listings Management
‚Ä¢	Add Listings:

o	Hosts can create property listings by providing details such as title, description, location, price, amenities, and availability.
‚Ä¢	Edit/Delete Listings:

o	Hosts can update or remove their property listings.
3. Search and Filtering
‚Ä¢	Implement search functionality to allow users to find properties by:

o	Location
o	Price range
o	Number of guests
o	Amenities (e.g., Wi-Fi, pool, pet-friendly)
‚Ä¢	Include pagination for large datasets.
4. Booking Management
‚Ä¢	Booking Creation:

o	Guests can book a property for specified dates.
o	Prevent double bookings using date validation.
‚Ä¢	Booking Cancellation:

o	Allow guests or hosts to cancel bookings based on the cancellation policy.
‚Ä¢	Booking Status:

o	Track booking statuses such as pending, confirmed, canceled, or completed.
5. Payment Integration
‚Ä¢	Implement secure payment gateways (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) to handle:

o	Upfront payments by guests.
o	Automatic payouts to hosts after a booking is completed.
‚Ä¢	Include support for multiple currencies.
6. Reviews and Ratings
‚Ä¢	Guests can leave reviews and ratings for properties.
‚Ä¢	Hosts can respond to reviews.
‚Ä¢	Ensure reviews are linked to specific bookings to prevent abuse.
7. Notifications System
‚Ä¢	Implement email and in-app notifications for:

o	Booking confirmations
o	Cancellations
o	Payment updates
8. Admin Dashboard
‚Ä¢	Create an admin interface for monitoring and managing:

o	Users
o	Listings
o	Bookings
o	Payments
üõ†Ô∏è Technical Requirements
1. Database Management
‚Ä¢	Use a relational database such as PostgreSQL or MySQL.
‚Ä¢	Required tables:

o	Users (guests and hosts)
o	Properties
o	Bookings
o	Reviews
o	Payments
2. API Development
‚Ä¢	Use RESTful APIs to expose backend functionalities to the frontend.
‚Ä¢	Include proper HTTP methods and status codes for:

o	GET (retrieve data)
o	POST (create data)
o	PUT/PATCH (update data)
o	DELETE (remove data)
‚Ä¢	Use GraphQL for complex data fetching scenarios 
3. Authentication and Authorization
‚Ä¢	Use JWT for secure user sessions.
‚Ä¢	Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to differentiate permissions between:

o	Guests
o	Hosts
o	Admins
4. File Storage (Scenario based)
‚Ä¢	Store property images and user profile photos in cloud storage solutions such as AWS S3 or Cloudinary. For implementation, we will use file storage
5. Third-Party Services
‚Ä¢	Use email services like SendGrid or Mailgun for email notifications.
6. Error Handling and Logging
‚Ä¢	Implement global error handling for APIs.
Non-Functional Requirements
1. Scalability
‚Ä¢	Use a modular architecture to ensure the app scales easily as traffic increases.
‚Ä¢	Enable horizontal scaling using load balancers.
2. Security
‚Ä¢	Secure sensitive data (e.g., passwords, payment information) using encryption.
‚Ä¢	Implement firewalls and rate limiting to prevent malicious activities.
3. Performance Optimization
‚Ä¢	Use caching tools like Redis to improve response times for frequently accessed data (e.g., search results).
‚Ä¢	Optimize database queries to reduce server load.
4. Testing
‚Ä¢	Implement unit and integration tests using frameworks like pytest .
‚Ä¢	Include automated API testing to ensure endpoints function as expected.
